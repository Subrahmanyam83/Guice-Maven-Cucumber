### MAVEN-CUCUMBER-GUICE PROJECT

#### Pre-Requisites
1. Make sure that the Runner class is under test/java folder and ends with Test(only if you want to run the Runner Class)- that is the nomenclature Cucumber follows and understands to execute the Runner Class.
2. In the RunnerClass, glue path should be 'steps' - which is relative to the src/main/java folder. Do not specify the path as 'src/main/java/steps'.
3. Put the feature files under test/resources or src/resources - it does not matter.
4. Need to have Selenium, Cucumber(cucumber-guice,cucumber-junit),
 Dependency Injection(guice) and Unit Test Framework Dependencies in pom.xml
5. Hooks's methods should be public and not private or else they wont be called.
 
#### Framework Structure
- CONFIGURATION: It contains the DependencyInjection Class which extends AbstractModule of guice and binds the 
Webdriver Class with the custom class we created(ChromeDriverFactory/FirefoxDriverFactory).
- HOOKS: Before and After hooks which runs before and After a test.
- PAGES: Contains Page specific methods.
- STEPS: Step definitions.
- RUNNER: Runner classes with Cucumber Options - Attach the glue to let the test know where to look for the step definitions(eg:steps)
- FEATURES: Feature files.

#### Dependency Injection
1. In the Pages inject the Webdriver dependency by either:
-    a. ```@Inject
       private WebDriver driver;``` //But this will create an instance of Webdriver everytime even when it is not invoked.
    or
-    b. ```@Inject
       private Provider<WebDriver> driver;```
           
   Here we are saying that whenever the Webdriver object is required then 'bind(WebDriver.class).toProvider(ChromeDriverFactory.class).in(ScenarioScoped.class);'
   is called which says that give the ChromeDriverFactory factory generated driver (from the get() method).
    
#### How to run test cases:
- To run the Runner Class(manually from IDE), include the following to the VM options in edit configurations: -Dguice.injector-source=configuration.DependencyInjection
(You have to only give this configuration when you have explicitly created an Injector class -in this case it is ''' DependencyInjection ''')
- To run the feature file, it automatically inserts the option in edit configuration.
- COMMAND LINE: ```mvn clean -Dguice.injector-source=configuration.DependencyInjection test``` or just ```mvn test```(as this has been added to the System Variable Property to the 
configuration of the maven surefire plugin or it is already mentioned in the src/main/resources/cucumber.properties)

#### Run test cases by passing cucumber options from CMD

##### Only Run a Scenarios with Tags:
```mvn -Dcucumber.options="--tags @subu" test```

##### Only Run a FEATURE:
```mvn -Dcucumber.options="src/test/resources/features/third-feature.feature" test```

#### Report Generation:
- After running the test cases using either of the 3 cases - feature file, runner class or command line, the Reports will be generated in ```target/cucumber/index.html``` folder.
- To get the Cucumber Masterthought Reports use the following command and the run the java/hooks/ReportHooks test method to generate reports:
```mvn -Dcucumber.options="--glue 'hooks' --glue 'steps' --tags @subu --plugin 'html:reports/html' --plugin 'junit:reports/report.xml' --plugin 'json:reports/report.json'" test```
- To get the normal Junit Reports from Cucumber, you need to have 'format = {"pretty", "html:target/cucumber" },' in the Runner File
#### CUCUMBER-MAVEN-PLUGIN: Usage to run parallelly.
- Add cucumber-maven-plugin in pom.xml with default configuration.
- Either you can add configs there or you can send it through command line:: Make sure you have the dependency Injector source class as System Property.
    eg: ``` mvn cucumber-runner:run ``` (-Dguice.injector-source=configuration.DependencyInjection option is specified by having a cucumber.properties in 
    src/main/resources folder, which is read by Guice for its Dependency Injection Class. Rest of the parameters like the features and include tags can be specified in the configuration of the cucumber plugin in pom.xml) or 
    as a command line parameters.
    ``` mvn -DcucumberRunner.features=src/main/resources/features -DcucumberRunner.includeTags=@subu cucumber-runner:run```
- Reports will be generated in the following path: target/cucumber/combined-html/cucumber-html-report/overview-features.html

#### SONAR Analysis
- Make sure the following settings are in the settings.xml file in .m2 folder
```<pluginGroups>
         <pluginGroup>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</pluginGroup>
   </pluginGroups>

   <profile>
         <id>sonar</id>
         <activation>
             <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
         </activation>
         <properties>
             <!-- Optional URL to server. Default value is http://localhost:9000 -->
             <sonar.host.url>
                 <URL where sonar is running>
             </sonar.host.url>
         </properties>
   </profile>
```

- Run the following command in the project root folder: 
```mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.analysis.mode=preview -Dsonar.issuesReport.html.enable=true```

#### Run the Test Cases using the Project JAR and Dependent JARS
1. Create an assembly plugin in pom.xml
2. Run the command: ```mvn clean test assembly:single -DskipTests```
3. In target folder it will create a jar file - ```test-guice-selenium-1.0-jar.jar```
4. Copy this JAR anywhere and run the following command.
```java -cp "test-guice-selenium-1.0-jar.jar" cucumber.api.cli.Main --glue "classpath:steps/" --glue "classpath:hooks" --plugin "html:reports/cucumber-reports/html" --plugin "junit:reports/cucumber-reports/report.xml" --plugin "json:reports/cucumber-reports/report.json" classpath:features/```
5. This will execute the test cases and create a folder where the jar is present with reports folder. We can use those JSON reports to create Masterthought Cucumber Reports.
